the playing field,two painted lethins should not stick 
together with each other, and allunpainted lethins form a
single continuous area. Cells with numbers canbe painted 
over, or you can leave unpainted, the numbers in blocks
denote the maximum size of a continuous line of unpainted
litelitins within a given block. The unpainted region does
not necessarily have to be equal to this number, but a
continuous line of unpainted litites is not may exceed this
value. Any continuous horizontal or vertical line of 
unpainted lethitins cannot cross more than one bold line.
